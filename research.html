                    <h3>January 2023 - March 2023</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>For an entrepreneurship class, I worked alongside 5 undergraduates to pitch a product as a solution for a product, and I held the role of Chief Information Officer (CIO) on the team. The problem we wanted to solve is that about 10% of Americans are diagnosed with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). The current solutions to this problem have flaws, so we pitched the idea of creating a virtual window called Brighten that could help improve the mental wellbeing of anyone suffering from SAD or looking to open up a windowless room. The product would be linked to a mobile app through which the user could control all their Brighten devices and control the images that show up on their virtual windows. There would be a variety of features available for the user to use, similar to editing photos on an IOS device, before uploading to their device. We also pitched a premium subscription service for the user to purchase extra features. The final presentation powerpoint highlights the financial calculations and customer feedback we also gathered to help us modify our idea and fit customer needs better.

                    <p>For the final project of a business writing class, 3 undergraduates and I created a recommendation report about the harmful effects of fluoride. To back up our claims that fluoride is detrimental to bone strength, we conducted a lab experiment to test the effects of fluoride and distilled water on bones.</p>

                    <p>Lead-contaminated water is a big issue around the world. Ghana is one of the countries that has seen dangerously high statistics of the problem. During the summer of 2021, I worked alongside three undergraduate students to design an affordable and reliable lead detection device that can alert households in Ghana when their water has dangerous levels of lead in their drinking water so action can be taken. This internship program was run by Worcester Polytechnic Institute. On the team, I held a leadership role and was primarily in charge of research. </p>
