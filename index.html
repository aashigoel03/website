                    <hr>
                    &nbsp
                    <p>
                    I am a third-year undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) from Winchester, MA, majoring in Robotics Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. Since a lot of my courses are project-based, I am accustomed to collaborating with other students to design and build autonomous robots used to complete projects and participate in robotics competitions. These experiences have allowed me to develop practical skills in areas such as robot navigation, sensor integration, and control systems. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    The main reason I decided to attend WPI is due to their renowned undergraduate robotics engineering program. With a background in robotics from high school, I was able to find and grow my passion for robots before making the decision to pursue it further in college. I was one of the only women on my high school’s robotics team and there were many challenges that came with that. During this time, I became an advocate for supporting women in STEM and started involving myself in volunteering programs to support this mission. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    As a roboticist, I strive to master the computer engineering side of the field. I have the most experience using C/C++ and Java. There are many paths of robotics that my career could take, and I strive to take the route that improves healthcare. It has been a dream of mine to work in the medical industry since childhood, and I am passionate about the idea of applying robotics to create medical devices that reduce the chance of human error and increase accuracy or creating prosthetics that would improve the lives of amputees. The intersection between technology and healthcare has the potential to revolutionize the medical field, streamline medical processes, and change countless lives. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy staying active, traveling, and spending time with my friends and family. I’ve grown up playing sports my entire life, including taekwondo, volleyball, and cross country. One of my greatest fitness accomplishments is earning my second-degree black belt in taekwondo. I like to take advantage of my close commute to the city by frequently taking local trips to Boston. One of my proudest accomplishments was when my family and I rebuilt our outdoor patio when we had extra time during the pandemic.
