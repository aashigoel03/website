                    <h2>Energy Efficiency Procurement Intern, National Grid</h2>
                    <h3>June 2023 - August 2023</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>National Grid is an international gas and electricity provider for homes and businesses in the US (Massachusetts & New York) and the UK.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As part of my role, I strategized and assisted with the execution of Request for Proposals (RFPs). For the RFP I worked on, I had to present my Gate 0 slide deck to higher management for approval. I also managed Energy Efficiency initiatives by executing contract changes to fit the stakeholders' needs. I also collaborated with stakeholders and my team to determine appropriate strategic sourcing methods. Being in communication with our stakeholders and suppliers, I worked to ensure our long-term relations with them stayed strong. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was invited to join a small committee by National Grid's Talent Acquisition team to help plan virtual and in-person networking events. I worked along with one intern to plan and facillitate two optional in-person events for all Massachusetts interns (about 65 total): a Networking Lunch & Headshots event in the office and a site visit tour at HVDC Sandy Pond. I worked with the other committee members to facillitate some virtual intern events for Massachusetts and New York interns, including National Intern Day trivia, a Thank You video from managers and mentors, and Virtual Bingo. All the events were successful and were great networking oppoortunities! </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>As a Customer Experience Intern, I independently worked on research projects to help revise customer strategy with the goal of increasing the company's customer satisfaction scores. I utilized research findings based on the energy industry as a whole and observed trends in high-scoring utility companies to recommend solutions to management. Additionally, I worked on and presented a case study with other interns to determine ways to increase customer engagement in company programs that help reach National Grid’s goal of Net Zero by 2050. My projects revolved around mobile app development, social media, and website analysis. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Post-internship, my research and recommendations were invested in for the development of a new company mobile app, which is currently an ongoing project. </p>
