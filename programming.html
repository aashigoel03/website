                    <p>Simon Says:</p>
                    <p>I programmed a “Simon Says” game on an MSP430F5529 microcontroller using switch cases and pointers. The game utilizes digital I/O by reading inputs from the keypad and setting the LEDs and buzzer as outputs. The MSP430 generates a random LED sequence for each level, and as the user wins rounds, the number of levels increases and the game goes faster until it reaches the 32nd level, which is the maximum. </p>

                    <p>Guitar Hero:</p>
                    <p>I programmed a simplified version of the Guitar Hero video game on an MSP430F5529 microcontroller using structs, switch cases, and pointers. First, each note of the song “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” was assigned one of four LED values and ceramic buzzer frequencies. Then, my function allows for the MSP430 to play each note of the song while flashing an LED and playing the buzzer, and it expects player input on one of four buttons. If the button that corresponds to the LED is pressed, the song continues until the last note and the player wins. Otherwise, they lose. This project utilized digital I/O and incorporated timers and interrupts. </p>

                    <h2>oSNAP Hackathon Project, GoatHacks (hosted by WPI)</h2>
                    <h3>January 2023</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        WPI has currently implemented SNAP (Student Night Assistance Patrol), which allows for students to book shuttle rides during the night hours of 5pm-3am through an app called Transloc. While the SNAP shuttle sounds like a convenient option, it is notorious for repeatedly pushing its ETA, and rides often take between 30-60 minutes to arrive. If SNAP cancels on a user, they have no choice but to walk to their destination. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The project provides a platform for WPI students to find peers to walk with as an alternative to SNAP or walking alone. While there wasn’t enough time for the team to fully develop the app, the idea was for it to match some features of Uber and Tinder’s mobile apps as we wanted users to have the option to find “buddies” they feel comfortable with (based on their individual profiles and ratings) and allow them to weigh their options based on destination arrival times and “buddies.” A mock-up of the user interface was implemented using Uizard, providing a preview of the application’s features and design. These features included creating an account, logging in, searching for buddies nearby, and viewing registered user’s profiles. The app mock-up is shown below.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The backend infrastructure was built in Rust with the Rocket framework and sqlite as a database system. We used Rust due to its high performance, strong compile-time checking, and memory safety. Rocket allowed us to easily serve, receive, parse, and validate json data as well as use multiple worker threads. Additionally, we intended to integrate with WebUI.

                    <p>
                        Features that we intended to implement but were unable to before the deadline include a failsafe emergency contact system, IP-based verification of WPI community membership, and a GPS and map system to track users and buddies as well as create the fastest route from the starting location to the ending location.
